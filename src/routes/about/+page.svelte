    <h2>NEEDS EDITS</h2>
    <p>With 3.5 years of experience in HTML and CSS, 2.5 years in JavaScript, 
        and 6 months in React I've developed a full stack inventory management 
        app currently used in the real world.</p>
    <p> I am passionate about interactive web design and solving 
        problems through a systematic approach. My career goals include front-end development and 
        eventually leading a full stack team. Thank you for exploring my work!</p>

    <p>&emsp; With a passion for solving real-world problems, I currently develop full stack apps using a combination 
        of HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, SvelteKit and Node.Js. With new technologies and challenges being discovered 
        everyday, I strive to continue learning and growing as a developer to stay ahead of the curve. When I'm not 
        coding, I like to spend my time learning languages, playing piano and organizing my space.</p>
