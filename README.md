## Purpose of this site
    The purpose of this site was to delve deeper to my understanding of static site generation and data handling. I've explored data retrieving, iteration and updating in svelte kit. I've also got a better understanding of SCSS and its role in a framework like SvelteKit (It has local styling). I've learned to make componenets that can be used all across my website.

    My most important take away from this assingment was the use of reactive variables to update a page without rebuilding it, I am going to see if I can implement this at my current job with my position as a full-stack developer.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
